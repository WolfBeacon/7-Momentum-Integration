## Contributing

* Your `master` branch should point to `origin/master`.

* **NEVER EVER WORK ON `master`**. Keep the `master` branch updated with upstream `git pull upstream master`. It's only to be used a reference/starting point.

* In reference to the above point, create a different branch for the issue you are working on off your master branch like `git checkout -b username-work`.

* Whenever you begin work, be sure to `git pull --rebase upstream master`.

* When you have completed, `git push origin username-work` and issue a PR to `wolfbeacon/4_cms_website`.

* In case you have a PR pending on this branch, `checkout` to your local `master` branch, `checkout` another `work` branch and work there. Needless to say, `git pull --rebase upstream master` is always important.
